# Pokémon Trainer CLI Application

## Overview

The Pokémon Trainer CLI Application is a text-based simulation game where users can interact with a command-line interface (CLI) to manage their Pokémon trainer profiles, catch wild Pokémon, and engage in simulated battles. The game explores the one-to-many relationship between Trainers and Pokémon, where each trainer can have multiple Pokémon, but each Pokémon belongs to only one trainer.

## Features

- **Catch Wild Pokémon**: Encounter and attempt to catch wild Pokémon with a 70/30 chance of success.
- **Battle Simulation**: Engage in battles with wild Pokémon using a random Pokémon from the Trainer's roster.
